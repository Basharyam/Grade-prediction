    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ”Ž A Brief Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>GradePredictor</strong> is a student-focused system that uses the power of machine learning 
        to forecast academic performance. The goal is to help students make smarter, faster, and more informed 
        decisions about their study paths by predicting course grades in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of guessing or relying only on past performance, students can receive data-driven predictions 
        about upcoming courses and plan their academic journey with greater confidence. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Key Goals -->
    <section>
      <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Key Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High accuracy:</strong> Deliver reliable grade predictions for future courses.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster decisions:</strong> Provide quick recommendations to support timely planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Serve a growing number of students while keeping the system responsive.</li>
        <li><strong>Big-data ready:</strong> Handle large histories of grades and academic records without slowing down.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast response:</strong> Return results almost instantly for an efficient user experience.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Model Explanation -->
    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ§  The Model Behind GradePredictor</h2>
      <p>
        Our system currently uses the <strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</strong> algorithm to make predictions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>How it works:</strong> KNN looks at past students with similar profiles (neighbors) 
            and uses their grades to estimate the most likely outcome for a new student.</li>
        <li><strong>Why KNN:</strong> Itâ€™s simple, effective, and works well with academic data where 
            similarities between students matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> KNN can adapt to new data, improving predictions as more student 
            records are added.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By combining KNN with preprocessing steps like feature encoding and scaling, 
        GradePredictor can generate meaningful insights from raw academic data.
      </p>

    <!-- Why It Matters -->
    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        GradePredictor empowers students to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand their potential outcomes before starting a course.</li>
        <li>Plan their academic journey based on data, not guesswork.</li>
        <li>Improve time management and study strategies with early insights.</li>
        <li>Build confidence when making critical academic decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At its heart, the project is about supporting student success and helping learners achieve their goals 
        with clarity and foresight.
